            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Very long ago, which it is said is also soon, when the land of the dead is first set foot in, the amnion of the Earth is splattered with volcanic mud. The mud begins to churn and currents coil up within it, it becomes the body of a festering sea serpent, teeming and bloating. Eventually the mire that is also the dragon turns into itself so much that a great pressure cleaves open its lower parts and a tomb is carved out in its sunless nether regions for all time. Yet on the surface above it, a pillar of foam fountains up, breaking the light of heaven so as to give the impression of a pale nymph clad in the feathers of a peacock angel. <a href="level02.html">She</a> is the daughter who earns her source the title Mother of Abominations as she rends the body of water asunder and lets it spawn the legions of sludge-sucking vermin that are to haunt the oceans throughout history. It is her curiosity for the other side that disinters these from their crypt of sediment. She emerges and treads through the offal of what predated her, fishing for a piece and partaking in it to sustain herself. <a href="level01a.html">>></a></p>
