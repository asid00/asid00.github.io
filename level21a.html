            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Any deeper excavation of bizarre '90s doomsday cults is bound to come across the name of abbess Kerstin Bauer. Little is known about Bauer's upbringing, but she herself has on at least two occasions described her parents as “suppliers” distributing unspecified metalwork throughout Western Germany and Austria at the time. Having lost her ancestral faith early in life, it was at the age of 15 that Bauer went through an intense mystical crisis (involving disturbing dreams, dissociation, experiences of missing time and epilepsy-like convulsions) that resulted in her decision to become a nun.</p>
            <p>On March 20th 1998, mere days after the High-Z Supernova Search Team publishes the first evidence of dark energy, Bauer — kneeling before the altar — was suddenly struck by such supernatural delights that she believed it was really god coming upon her. It was only later that she realized this descent from the sacred to have been the coincidental discovery of the “<a href="level22.html">trypophilic</a> technique” that would become the basis of her subsequent teachings. Originally, these were restricted to (in their own right remarkable) alloys of contemporary performance and visionary work: on one occasion having herself be willingly entombed in a holed-out Romanesque complex of <a href="level03.html">underground</a> cells as her fellow nuns pushed the minimalism of monophonic chant to its blunt force limit</p>
