            <p>Zodiacs at the dawn of the sky tamed chaos, serving as the black screen to scry upon and melt the world ice, celestial waters come down and trigger memories of pre-religious geometry.</p>
            <p>Trinity of astronomical modalities makes for the 12 periods of 30°</p>
            <p>makes for the full 360° zodiacal belt</p>
            <p>makes for the star signs</p>
            <p>Each of the triplicate element is recursively fragmented into 3 periods of 10°, referred to as the decans</p>
            <p>Ascendant</p>
            <p>Succedent</p>
            <p>Cadent</p>
            <p id="anchor">&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The columns descending from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd glyphs >> mapped onto Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable. The rows unfolding from the 1st, 4th and 7th >> mapped onto Ascendant, Succedent and Cadent decans.</p>
            <p>While another instance of the triadic sequence Sulfur, Salt and Mercury is feasibly projected onto the columns</p>
            <p>what they most immediately lend themselves to is coincidence with the descending triads on the Hebrew Tree of Life (a Supernal triad fittingly composed of the spheres in numerological correspondence with 1, 2 and 3, an Ethical triad of those with 4, 5 and 6 and an Astral triad of those with 7, 8 and 9). Within that tradition, these triads are respectively focussed on what it — in its Christian phase — comes to call the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Reading the rows of a quarter as lines (such as those of a sacred text, program or poem) thus announces the trinitarian name of the sacred that is proper to a given tetradic element.</p>

            <p>message = “North-Western esoteric customs recognize the identity between their zodiac and cartomancy, the alphanumpad however departs from tradition here in order to carry it on — maintaining its momentum rather than its position as it splits along the line of thought that regards how to approach an apparent problem: namely that there are actually 10 — not 9 — numbered cards in each suit. Classically, this is dealt with by extracting the 1s, Aces, to figure them as transcendent overseers ruling over the entire field of their associated suit, conceiving them as the kings of their race of elemental spirits</p>
