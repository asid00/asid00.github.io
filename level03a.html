            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>19.??.2038 23:55. Arcadia Internet Lounge. Your carrier is Zesil Epo: a regular at Arcadia, transsexually feminine and clad in machine-emo bandagewear that is as much <a href="level07.html">pharmaceutical</a> utility as it is an evocation of JRPG Haute Couture. Beneath it you sport a strange amalgam of senescent and neotenous features; a side effect to being one of the select few in the know about the secret menu here, but you will remember much more of this later.</p>
            <p>At the door the bouncer asks whether you're aware that it's a <a href="level08.html">birthday</a> party tonight and whose birthday it is. It's a trick question. Once inside, you can buy as many stimulant drinks of your choice as the crypto in your <a href="level05.html">wallet</a> suffices for.</p>
