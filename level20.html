            <p>There are still recognitions, somehow: that these designations are of a nature that long dead mystics once termed angelic, that this is no region whose coordinate’s Earth’s satellites could locate nor a time whose date history could fix, a territory most games refuse to play on, the outermost layer of existence where real communication and real warfare occurs, and where your real agency lies, that the end of yourself does not lie within you but in an extraterrestrial gameplan about which nothing can be decided in advance. <a href="level20a.html">>></a></p>
