            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Speaking of currency, you're here for an infojob. You are to gather intelligence on a <a href="level16.html">conflict</a> of which you know exactly two things: it constitutes a crucial threshold in planetary history and everything that could be communicated about it publicly is necessarily a cover story. Of course what it will look like instead is that you're just another libertine out chasing your fix, but that's perfect camouflage. Besides, unsound methods are just tactics that have become so ruthlessly efficient they cancel out the strategic directives they were ostensibly facilitating. At least that's what you tell yourself before passing beyond the main seating area. Behind an unassuming curtain, a corridor equal parts sleek and sleazy reveals itself to you. You search among the numerous doors, first for one labeled with what might be the figure of a snake, a stylized representation of a spine or the letter 'S' — then for another marked with what could be an 'L', a masonic square or a crook. <a href="level05a.html">>></a></p>
