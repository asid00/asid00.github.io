            <h3>Metamorphoses of Control by Donatella Demuth</h3>
            <p>'The Raft of the Medusa', by Théodore Géricault, has inscribed itself upon the DNA of 19th century painting and French cultural-historical identity. The large-scale tragedy unfolding before the viewer's eyes is an attempt at a historiographic narrative that has subsequently been interpreted, discussed, and attacked in the context of various political discourses critical of power.</p>
            <p>However, the fact that the painting was created for the Paris Salon, which historically marked a new accessibility of art, especially for the bourgeoisie, is equally important and opens up a line of communication with the present: in the Salon, the competition between the paintings and their resulting transformation becomes clear as soon as we view see halls in dense Petersburg hanging. The salon thus becomes a model design of the post- digital "flood of images" - one more reason to consider the raft as a sign of the present as well.</p>
            <p>In the early inflationary image culture of the Salon, provocation of scandal was part of a painterly strategy to make one's self visible in the system. Immediately, artists started resorting to the offensive "in the framework" - a drooping girder, <i>a nude woman who was not an allegory</i>, or even the Raft of the Medusa, through which Géricault aimed at an outrage that never manifested.</p>
            <p>The cultural history of the image is extensive, poetically and musically. It is only Géricault's pictorial narration that gives rise to the historical memory of the castaways of the Medusa.</p>
            <p>Most recently, I came across a particular video installation (serving as simultaneous documentation of a performance) by contemporary German-French artist Isabella Fürnkäs. The title — 'Metamorphoses of Control' — is open, in many ways. Definitely, it plugs into the radical upheavals connected to digitalization (to which I will invariably return). The performers in 'Metamorphoses[...]' sit on a luminous plateau, a few props like smartphones, masks and sand are scattered around. All, dressed from head to toe in white, wear a plastic sheath around their clothing. They move slowly, pushing the sands back and forth like anaesthesized desert wind, occasionally moving their phones. Fürnkäs rarely performs herself in the performances she puts into play. She uses the principle of staged performance - just as for Géricault, for example, the raft becomes the stage for his personal narrative of tragedy, we cannot avoid reading Fürnkäs' Plateau as the stage of a stagnant tragedy of the post-digital individual. The motif of the castaway's struggle for survival undergoes a strange transformation; nothing happens jerkily, the drama lies much more in the slowness of the movements. That precisely in this, however, a form of the struggle for survival also emerges, is described — for example — by Byung Chul Han in his formula of contemporary life as survival: "Today we spend our best efforts on prolonging life. In reality, life is shortening to survival. We live to survive. The hysteria of health and the mania for optimization are reflexes to the prevailing lack of being."</p>
            <p>As life becomes survival, or — better yet — undead shambling, the collective human subject is also upon its sinking raft, paradise lost with melancholia phasing in and out of the dissolutive riptide-pulse of capital.</p>
            <p>Fürnkäs' work, however, is - and this is where it deviates from that of Géricault - not an attack on a ruling elite. The people on the raft appear like a cohesive unit, floating in the water for themselves in a simultaneity of communion and isolation. Access to the internet is global, and questions of individual digital representation become a universal rite of passage.</p>
            <p>The same 2 poles can also readily be discovered in Géricault's painting. The attempt to depict the utter brutality of power relations is driven ad absurdum in the context of art as entertainment and, thereby, voyeuristic object.</p>
            <p>Yet the raft is also the frame for common tragedy. And this is similarly the case with Fürnkäs' version: the masks, sand, and mobile phones are particularly striking. The smartphone is not a symbol for digitalization, it has become the immediate prosthesis of every person - performances with phones are in this sense more human than a performance without them. The mask, on the other hand, belongs to it like it belongs to aforementioned humanity. The most inconspicuous, but possibly most remarkable element of the performance is the sand, gracefully pushed back and forth between the performers in slow movements. It can be read as a sign, quoting Alina Klappert: "Sand is treated as a metaphorical model of virtuality given its quality as a medium, i.e. its openness to shaping and dissolving different forms." Virtuality is the quality of a thing not existing in the form in which it appears to exist, but resembling in its essence or effect a thing existing in that form.</p>
            <p>In the age of the virtual, Géricault's vision of the castaways' raft — marked by cannibalism as it is — decays into poetic utterances by the performers, translating them into an individualistic reality such as "I ate my own placenta". Out of this narrative, the artist constructs a veritable cannibalism of the self, as a psychic state of emergency. Skin and consciousness are tangibly conflated, as are consumption and person. As in Expressionist painting, for example, experience inscribes itself in the body; yet the setting is still a backdrop, framed by masks and phones.</p>
            <p>In a competitive culture of images, beginning with the salon and climaxing at the bleeding edge of modernity, the contemporary artist becomes a particle of the much bemoaned "flood of images", and compensating for this through extravagance and <a href="sheddingSkins.html">self</a>-mystification within digital worlds of representation. The fact that these ethological schemata also operate beneath the surface of Géricault's raft is frighteningly inspiring.</p>
            <p>So what to make of this? Perhaps art must also be stripped of authorship, the artist a figure akin to the zombified performers of Fürnkäs, or the dying in Géricault. What role does thought play here? Is intelligence networking, convergence upon singularity? Are "we" naive enough to hope for the beginning of a new collectivity?</p>
