            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Very long ago, which it is said is also soon, when the land of the dead is first set foot in, the amnion of the Earth is splattered with volcanic mud. The mud begins to churn and currents coil up within it, it becomes the body of a festering sea serpent, teeming and bloating. Eventually the mire that is also the dragon turns into itself so much that a great pressure cleaves open its lower parts and a tomb is carved out in its sunless nether regions for all time. Yet on the surface above it, a pillar of foam fountains up, breaking the light of heaven so as to give the impression of a pale nymph clad in the feathers of a peacock angel. <a href="level02.html">She</a> is the daughter who earns her source the title Mother of Abominations as she rends the body of water asunder and lets it spawn the legions of sludge-sucking vermin that are to haunt the oceans throughout history. It is her curiosity for the other side that disinters these from their crypt of sediment. She emerges and treads through the offal of what predated her, fishing for a piece and partaking in it to sustain herself.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of years the Atlantean mission held as paramount the understanding of heaven's messages. Launching from the first observatory, it has been preserved in the alchemical traditions, and the mystery schools before that. Earth had traded with the Queen of Heaven twice prior: once when the stiffened planet initially got wet and life arose from its newly acquired oceans, and another time when scale-plated saurians melted into mammals. With each it inherited a drop of her black blood which dried to become the sacred stones of Baetylus processions. Rumors that space and <a href="level03.html">intelligence</a> agencies are infiltrated by secret societies are misguided only insofar as they miss the kinship of the projects, the continuity of the directives at hand.</p>

Marketing agencies get a headrush, feverishly contacting each other yet each denying its own hand in the making.
