            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>You have been selected by Dogma Genetics because your archaeological background has equipped you to speak the language of the anorganic, the tongue of the basilisk — intercourse with the catatonic metamind into which all narratives are sedimented. The Anatolians had already developed a signals analysis that regarded causality as but another layer of encryption to be stripped away, and they traded on it. Back in the cave the shadows on the wall diffuse layer by layer into a grid of <a href="level08d.html"> six-by-six </a>glyphs, numbers and letters in particular arrangement, and the hiss of underworld rivers assembles into the corroded hum of a nymph that lays in magnetic trance at the bottom of the sea: “Disinter from this spell a cloud of miasma, it shall eat the sickness even if the body will not surely die,” it whispers. Dogma got all that it needed, taking the alphanumeric formula to be Python scripture encrypting a genetic sequence to be <a href="level16.html">printed</a> up.</p>
