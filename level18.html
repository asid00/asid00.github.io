            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Your other body floats in what appears to sit somewhere in the latent space between a rainforest during monsoon and an undersea brine pool. Nature drips in continual putrefaction. You get entirely carried away, dissolving and becoming indistinguishable from the uncongealed space that holds you. It feels impossible, losing any sense of its limits, confused and turning endlessly into itself. What is left of your identity flickers out of focus. One layer gets stripped away at a time, in exact correspondence to a successive dismantling of neural levels from the top down: the human is the first to go, followed by the mammal, the animal and — finally — life. You feel nothing as you migrate into the desolate <a href="level09.html">plane</a> of raw impulse. <a href="level18a.html">>></a></p>
