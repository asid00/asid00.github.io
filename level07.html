            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Synthesis of image: it shows a eunuch priest wearing a black feather dress in a desolate, moonlit neolithic tundra. The face is covered by a mask made of bird bones and iron instruments. Speech erupts suddenly from the figure: “I, Harralpirlu, pronounce the Iron Eagle Sky Mother to predate me,” referring to a near universal pattern of Old World rites that involve a metallic bird of prey taking a medicine man (but primordially a <a href="level21.html">woman</a>) to the spirit world. Without warning, the air is rent by hideous shrieks testifying to suffering beyond human comprehension. The <a href="level15.html">shaman</a> convulses abominably as if drawn upwards into an invisible devouring entity. Harralpirlu is cut to pieces, limbs removed and disjointed, bones cleaned, flesh scraped, the bodily fluids thrown outward and the eyes torn from their sockets.</p>
