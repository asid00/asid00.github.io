            <h3>The Other at the Gates</h3>
            <p>It is common knowledge that the “end of history” ended on September 11, 2001. After the fall of the Soviet Union, there was only one civilization left: The Western World, combining liberal democracy with free market capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>Geopolitically, this correlates with a situation dubbed "The Unipolar Moment" by Charles Krauthammer. Previously, the world had been divided into two large camps: The “West”, led by the USA and organised into NATO, and the Soviet-dominated “East”. With the surrender of the latter, the former became the undisputed hegemon of the world. Being the “unchallenged superpower”, the US was conceptualized as a global government. Viewed from an empirical or ontic perspective, one could point to the fact that military conflicts were still taking place, and infer that world peace had not actually been achieved; this perspective however ignores that the function of Western military activity was, in its essence, nothing but the enforcement of principles that had already won. They were means to achieve a goal that was humanitarian and economic at the same time, to accelerate an inevitable world-process. The Gulf War and the NATO missions in former Yugoslavia were large-scale police actions, and the armies of the West were at no point involved in a life-or-death, or faced with serious opposition.
            </p>
            <p>Regarding internal politics, the Fukuyamaist period was marked by a thorough depoliticization. The fall of the Soviet Union retroactively vindicated Thatcher’s slogan that “There Is No Alternative” to neoliberal capitalism, which was more expressive of wishful thinking than of reality at the time it was formulated. Narrowed down to different shades of free-market ideology, the horizon of the possible dictated that incremental improvements of the existing arrangement were the only form of politics to be taken seriously.
            </p>
            <p>For the left, the 90’s were a time of defeat, surrender, hopelessness, and isolation. This experience clouds its ability to properly grasp the situation as it presented itself to the rest of society. In fact, the end of history was, for the majority of Westerners, a time of profound optimism. Witnessing the inevitable advance of liberalism, democracy, and capitalism inspired a belief in the actuality of progress. Despite the prevalence of postmodern ideas among intellectuals, the linear-progressive view of history was alive and well during the 1990’s. People felt safe, sharing in the conviction that the world they were living in was both subjectively rational and objectively necessary. Just like the political thinkers of the 19th century, they were fully convinced that history was on their side, that it was, in and for itself, good. The Capitalist Realism of the pre-2001 world was a joyful one, and the lack of alternatives has to be read as analogous to the Marxist belief in the inevitability of communism. It is a testament to Fukuyama’s intellectual abilities that he immediately understood this; only through the lens of a Hegelian framework could the Unipolar Moment be properly grasped.

            <p>In 'Empire' (published in 2000), Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt claim that there is nothing outside of globalised world capitalism. The world is “politically united”, “the market is global”, and “power is organized throughout this universality”, and the “external standpoint no longer exists”. Despite the Spenglerian insistence on cultural relativity that was (and still is) so popular among academics, the actual consciousness of the 90’s was monist. There was one culture – American consumer culture – and one civilisation – the globalised West.
            </p>
            <p>Countries and geographic regions were characterized mainly by the degree to which they were Americanized. Progress was linear, but spatially differentiated. The future was unevenly distributed. There were temporally advanced spaces – Western Europe, Japan – and temporally backwards ones, but they were simply occupying different positions on one and the same path. Before 9/11, becoming-america was the universal tendency, the only conceivable political and historical movement. This was a world without borders. Its spatial map was a gradient, a smooth transition from past to future, from the periphery to New York.
            </p>
            <p>The attacks of September 11 were the first contact with something external, something utterly foreign. Osama Bin Laden attacked the symbols of Fukuyamaism, the heart of financial capitalism. Designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the Twin Towers were built in the style of New Formalism, referencing the universalist tendencies of early 20th century architects such as Le Corbusier. But while such predecessors felt that their work was part of a evolving dynamism which has yet to conquer the world, Yamasakis gothic modernism expressed a confidence that the substantial tasks of humanity are already fulfilled. America is invincible, immutable, eternal.
            </p>
            <p>Precisely because the World Trade Center served as the ultimate symbol of Pax Americana could its destruction by Middle Eastern terrorists effectively signify the end of an era. The counterrevolution was televized. This was the last time that a major historical event was consumed through the medium of television. The whole world was watching the same images, live, at the same time. In contrast to previous blows to modernist aspirations such as the other 9/11 – the destruction of the Chilean experiment in 1973 – or the Club of Rome report of the same year, this event was truly public. Even the most apolitical (“idiotic” in ancient Greek parlance) elements of society could instinctively feel that something mind-shattering had happened, that the world had changed.
            </p>
            <p>From now on, everyone was obsessed with the “Clash of Civilizations”. What was previously viewed as a backwards region making small steps towards Westernization now became a cultural and ideological enemy. 9/11 marked a tectonic shift in global politics and perceptions, ushering in a new era of conflict and tension between what was now conceived of as distinct cultural spheres. The monist world made way for multipolarity and pluralism. Linear progress was dead and buried not only for academics and intellectuals, but for ordinary people.
