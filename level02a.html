            <h3>Period of HOZ</h3>
            <p>Developing the astrotheological line of thought, Bauer grasped the historicity of actually existing Christianity with its fish-protagonist <a href="level10.html">Ichthys</a> and thus arrived at her ultimate heresy: the prophecy of an Aquarian messiah that would absolve Christ of his position and who she came to know as Zoe. The name is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Eve, a name literally referring to the cunning primitive <a href="level09.html">substrate</a> of life.</p>
